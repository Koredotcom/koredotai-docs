  <summary>What is a Transition?
  </summary>


 
  Transition is a logical step in dialog flow from one node to another as per the bot definition. For example, consider the “Flight Ticket Booking” dialog, the flow is defined to ask the user for ‘Source City’ followed by ‘Destination city’. So, there is a transition from Entity (SourceCity) to Entity (DestinationCity). Likewise, a dialog task can have any number of Valid Transitions.
