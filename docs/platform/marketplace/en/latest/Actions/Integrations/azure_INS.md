**Authorization**
 
To connect to Azure OpenAI, Kore.ai uses basic authentication. The end-user can use pre-authorized credentials provided by the developer during the configuration process or their own authorization profile during the configuration process to let the end user authorize during the conversation.

**Pre-authorize the Integration**
 
 To make the integration process smoother for customers, you can pre-authorize it by providing the necessary authorization credentials to obtain the access token.

**Basic**
 
1. There are a few pre-requisites before you can setup the integration.
 
   a. An Azure subscription
 
   b. Access granted to Azure OpenAI in the desired Azure subscription
 
   c. An Azure OpenAI resource with a model deployed.
 
2. Following details are required to enable the integration.
 
   a. ENDPOINT : This value can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. Alternatively, you can find the value in       Azure OpenAI Studio > Playground > Code View. An example endpoint is: docs-test-001.openai.azure.com
  
   b. API-KEY : This value can be found in the Keys & Endpoint section when examining your resource from the Azure portal. You can use either KEY1 or KEY2.
 
   c. DEPLOYMENT-NAME : This value will correspond to the custom name you chose for your deployment when you deployed a model. This value can be found under Resource       Management > Deployments in the Azure portal or alternatively under Management > Deployments in Azure OpenAI Studio.
