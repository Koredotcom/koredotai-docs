### Description

The AI agent in this case is designed to analyze chat transcripts between customers and support agents, with the goal of assessing the quality of the customer service interaction. By processing the content of the chat, the agent can determine the level of customer satisfaction (CSAT) and assign a score to quantify it. Additionally, the AI agent evaluates the performance of the support agent based on their responses, tone, and effectiveness in addressing the customer's concerns. This analysis helps organizations monitor and improve their customer service quality, ensuring that customers receive satisfactory assistance and support agents are performing at their best.
