### Description

The AI tool in this case is designed to analyze chat transcripts between customers and support tools, with the goal of assessing the quality of the customer service interaction. By processing the content of the chat, the tool can determine the level of customer satisfaction (CSAT) and assign a score to quantify it. Additionally, the AI tool evaluates the performance of the support tool based on their responses, tone, and effectiveness in addressing the customer's concerns. This analysis helps organizations monitor and improve their customer service quality, ensuring that customers receive satisfactory assistance and support tools are performing at their best.
