### Description

The AI agent is designed to automate the grading process for student assignments or tests. By inputting all the test documents into the system, the AI agent analyzes the content based on custom criteria set by the user, such as keywords, concepts, or specific requirements. The agent then ranks the candidates or students according to their performance and assigns appropriate grades based on the evaluation. This system aims to streamline the grading process, reduce manual effort, and provide consistent and objective assessment of student work
