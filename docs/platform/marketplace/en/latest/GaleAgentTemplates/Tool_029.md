### Description

This Freshdesk integration tool allows you to retrieve comprehensive details about any
support ticket in your helpdesk. Whenever a new ticket is created or an existing one gets
updated, the tool automatically fetches all relevant information including the ticket ID,
current status (like Open, Pending, or Closed), priority level (from Low to Urgent), and
any custom fields you've configured.
