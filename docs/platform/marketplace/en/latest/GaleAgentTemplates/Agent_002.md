### Description

This agent is responsible for the final step in the meeting preparation workflow: delivering insights and action items to the calendar owner. It begins by receiving the complete, unaltered output from the Agenda Researcher, including detailed insights, clear action items, and supporting explanations. Using the calendar owner's email ID, the agent formats the message appropriately for the selected communication channelâ€”such as email or instant messaging. It then sends the message through one or more channels to maximize visibility and ensure timely delivery. By doing so, the agent guarantees that the calendar owner receives a structured and actionable summary of the meeting content directly in their inbox or messaging platform of choice.
