### Description

The AI tool is designed to streamline the insurance claims process for vehicle damage. By uploading an image of the damaged vehicle to an open-source platform, the tool can detect and analyze the image to identify the specific parts that have been affected. Using the detailed information gathered from the image analysis, the tool then accesses a database to retrieve the prices for the damaged parts. Finally, the tool generates a comprehensive total bill for the damage, which can be used by the insurance company to process the claim efficiently and accurately.
