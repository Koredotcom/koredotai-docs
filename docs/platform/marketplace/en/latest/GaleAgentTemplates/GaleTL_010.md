### Description

This AI agent specializes in content summarization with a unique two-step approach. Initially, it uses one model to create a summary of the given content. Then, it employs a separate model to evaluate the quality and accuracy of this summary. Based on the evaluation results, the agent generates a refined, more precise summary that addresses any shortcomings identified in the first attempt. This iterative process ensures a high-quality final summary that captures the essence of the original content while maintaining accuracy and relevance.
