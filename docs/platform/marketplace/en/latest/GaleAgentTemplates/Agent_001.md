### Description

This agent helps calendar owners stay organized and well-prepared for their meetings by performing several key tasks. First, it retrieves essential metadata about a meeting using just the meeting ID. It then analyzes the agenda topics to uncover background information, trends, and relevant technical insights. The agent also reviews information about attendees, surfacing past interactions and contextual data that may be useful. After gathering this information, it generates a structured response containing actionable insights and recommendations. Finally, it delivers the response directly to the calendar owner through a dedicated response manager, ensuring timely and efficient communication. This end-to-end process empowers calendar owners to enter meetings informed and follow up with clarity and confidence.
