### Description

This agent can perform various natural language processing tasks on English audio files stored in a repository. First, it can automatically transcribe the audio into text. Next, it can translate the text into other languages if needed. Additionally, it can create summaries of the transcripts to pull out key ideas and concepts. Furthermore, the agent can detect intents - categorizing audio into domains like inquiries, complaints, etc based on textual content. Finally, it is able to perform keyword/keyphrase extraction to pull out the most salient topics and themes present across a collection of transcripts.
