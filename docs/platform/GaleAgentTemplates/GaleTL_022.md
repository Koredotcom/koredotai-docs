The AI agent's function is to provide a concise summary of the user's latest unread inbox messages. This feature helps users quickly grasp the main points of their incoming emails without having to read through each message in its entirety. By generating brief summaries, the agent saves users valuable time and allows them to prioritize their email responses more efficiently. The AI-powered summaries enable users to stay on top of their inbox, even when dealing with a high volume of incoming messages.
