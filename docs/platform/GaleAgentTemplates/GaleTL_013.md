This AI agent is designed to enhance customer communication by refining and improving bot-generated responses. It takes the original bot output and rephrases it to create a more customer-friendly and empathetic message. The agent's primary goal is to ensure that automated responses sound more natural, personable, and considerate of the customer's needs and emotions. By doing so, it aims to improve the overall customer experience and foster better relationships between businesses and their clients, even in automated interactions.
